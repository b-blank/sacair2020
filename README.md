# StarGAN-ZSVC: Towards zero-shot voice conversion in low-resource contexts
Blank and Blank.

## Demo voice conversion samples
Here we provide samples of converted speech for comaprison of zero-shot voice conversion models, namely comparing AutoVC and the proposed StarGAN-ZSVC model. Below are conversions given for various seen/unseen source/target pairings, as evaluated on the test set. The samples were chosen by sampling 3 indices from the test set in each case using a random seed of 8.
